								<h2>Carey Walberg</h2>
								<p>Carey brings a strong user experience focus to One Plus One. She's a CXA with Human Factors International as well as an experienced user researcher who loves to help clients figure out what they need. Carey is constantly smiling, probably because she's always thinking 2 steps ahead of everyone else. She also happens to frequent great restaurants and bars all over the Twin Cities. (yep, we know, Carey sounds cooler than Brian)</p>

							<h2>Brian Steele</h2>
							<p>Brian has an extensive graphic and web design background. Several years ago, he decided to make the jump in to building sites and applications to pair alongside his design skills. Brian is a tad sarcastic and an extreme extrovert (just ask Carey). When he's not making things for clients, you'll probably find him exploring Minneapolis, always on foot or bike.</p>
